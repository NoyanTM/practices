* Platform / Infrastructure Compromise: undermining repository integrity
** Goal: Modify repository behavior, tamper index or distribution artifacts
*** Vector: Exploit Unpatched Service Components (various CVE techniques)
**** Means: Vulnerabilities in web servers, package index software, or middleware
**** Mitigation: Regular patching, vulnerability management, hardened configurations
*** Vector: Stolen Service/API Keys (T1528, T1537)
**** Means: Leaked keys in logs, repos, or third-party integrations (T1528)
**** Mitigation: Key rotation, secrets scanning, vaulting, least privilege
*** Vector: Misconfigured Access Controls (T1078, RBAC issues)
**** Means: Overbroad admin roles, missing RBAC constraints
**** Mitigation: RBAC, separation of duties, sudo approvals, audit logging
*** Vector: Third-party Dependency Compromise (T1195.*)
**** Means: Malicious/compromised libs used by platform components
**** Mitigation: SBOM for platform, supply-chain checks, attestations
*** Vector: Moderation/Policy Abuse (T1566 / social engineering of staff)
**** Means: Attacker bypasses moderation to allow malicious packages
**** Mitigation: Multi-review moderation, automated policy enforcement, moderator training
*** Consequences
**** Index manipulation, poisoned metadata, mass distribution of malicious artifacts
*** Detection / Response
**** Controls: Integrity checksums, signed indices, anomaly detection on package metadata, incident playbook, immutable backups
